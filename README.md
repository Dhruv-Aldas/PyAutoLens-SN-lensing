#  PyAutoLens package set up
Strong lensing model code for MACS J0138 Supernova system using PyAutoLens. Note: There is an error on Windows for the dynesty package which gives the "file already exists error". A previous commit was uploaded with this issue in the notebook. It has been updated with a working file now.
